Unit #3 Homework: Python

## Background

This assignment in composed of two parts. The first part, PyBank, takes in a large amount of data consisting of profits and losses. We need to find the total profits/losses over the period as well as the average change during that time. Additionally, we were responsible for finding which period had the greatest profit and which period had the greatest loss. The second part of the assignment, PyPoll, takes in a large amount of election data. This data is then used to find which candidates received votes, each candidate's total votes, and the percentage of those votes for each candidate. Finally, we had to find the winner of the election. 

## Results and Conclusions

The results of PyBank are:
- A calculation for the total months (the period)
- The total profit/losses for the company
- The average change over the period, and
- The greatest increase and decrease over the period
- An exported text file for easy viewing

The results of PyPoll are:
- The total votes
- The names of each candidate and their total votes
- The percentage of votes each candidate received
- The winner of the election

### Conclusions
The results produced for PyBank allow us to draw conclusions and give insight into the company's profits and losses. From the total, we can conclude the company was able to make an overall profit over the period. The average change, $-8,311.11 tells us that the company has room for improvement, however. The greatest increase and decrease allow us to see periods where the company was thriving and other times when they were struggling. This data is a great starting point because we can use it to determine what factors are possibly influencing the profits and losses. 

The results for PyPoll allow us to see which candidates received votes and how many total votes they earned. By knowing the overall total number of votes and each candidate's vote totals, we can find the percentage each candidate earned. This percentage can give us a better idea of how convincingly a candidate won or loss. In this case, Diana DeGette won easily and Raymon Anthony Doane struggled. Further analysis could allow us to see how each candidate faired in each county. This information would be valuable for the candidates to let them know where they need to improve their campaign efforts.
